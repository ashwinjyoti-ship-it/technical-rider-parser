## Tips & Tricks

### Getting Best Results

**1. Use Standard Formats**
   - Follow typical technical rider structure
   - Use section headers (Microphones, DI, etc.)
   - Include quantities with "x" notation

**2. Clear Specifications**
   - Include brand names
   - Specify model numbers
   - Use full equipment names

**3. Consistent Notation**
   - Good: "04 x Shure SM58"
   - Good: "6 x Active DI boxes (Radial)"
   - Avoid: "some microphones"
   - Avoid: "various DI boxes"

### Common Patterns Recognized

**Quantity Indicators:**
- `04 x` ‚Üí "04 x Shure SM58"
- `6 pcs` ‚Üí "6 pcs DI boxes"
- `8 units` ‚Üí "8 units IEM"
- `2 x` ‚Üí "2 x Floor monitors"

**Brand Detection:**
- Microphones: Shure, Sennheiser, AKG, DPA, Audix, Neumann
- DI: Radial, BSS, Klarkteknik
- Monitors: L'Acoustic, Meyer Sound, d&b
- IEM: Sennheiser, Shure PSM

### Maximizing Accuracy

**Do:**
- ‚úì Upload original technical riders
- ‚úì Ensure text is searchable (not scanned images)
- ‚úì Use standard equipment names
- ‚úì Review results for accuracy

**Don't:**
- ‚úó Use vague descriptions
- ‚úó Scan documents as images only
- ‚úó Mix multiple riders in one file
- ‚úó Rely 100% without review

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues

**Problem: "No file provided"**
- Solution: Ensure file is properly selected
- Check: File isn't corrupted

**Problem: "Invalid file type"**
- Solution: Only use PDF, DOCX, or TXT
- Check: File extension is correct

**Problem: "File too large"**
- Solution: File must be under 16MB
- Try: Compress PDF or split large riders

### Processing Issues

**Problem: "Error processing file"**
- Solution: File might be corrupted
- Try: Re-export from original source
- Check: File isn't password-protected

**Problem: No equipment detected**
- Solution: Document might not contain standard patterns
- Try: Check if text is searchable
- Verify: Equipment lists are clearly formatted

### Results Issues

**Problem: Incorrect counts**
- Reason: Non-standard formatting
- Solution: Review source document
- Note: Parser uses pattern matching

**Problem: Missing brands**
- Reason: Brand not in database
- Solution: Brand may not be recognized
- Workaround: Manually add to report

**Problem: Duplicate counts**
- Reason: Equipment listed multiple times
- Solution: Review source for duplicates
- Note: Parser counts all matches

### Technical Issues

**Problem: App won't start**
```
Solution 1: Check Python version
‚Üí python3 --version
‚Üí Should be 3.8 or higher

Solution 2: Reinstall dependencies
‚Üí pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

Solution 3: Check port availability
‚Üí Port 5000 might be in use
‚Üí Change in app.py: app.run(port=5001)
```

**Problem: Can't access http://localhost:5000**
```
Solution 1: Check if app is running
‚Üí Look for "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000" message

Solution 2: Try alternative URL
‚Üí http://127.0.0.1:5000
‚Üí http://0.0.0.0:5000

Solution 3: Check firewall
‚Üí Firewall might be blocking
‚Üí Allow Python through firewall
```

**Problem: Download button doesn't work**
```
Solution 1: Check browser compatibility
‚Üí Use modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
‚Üí Enable JavaScript

Solution 2: Check pop-up blocker
‚Üí Disable pop-up blocker for localhost
‚Üí Allow downloads

Solution 3: Try different browser
‚Üí Test in another browser
‚Üí Clear browser cache
```
